### Java TestNG examples with the [Surefire Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/)

Two WebDriver tests running in parallel in more than one thread and more than one browser/platform combination, the tests are running on [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/)

#### Environment Setup:

1. Global Dependencies
    * [Install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
    * Or Install Maven with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
    ```
    $ brew install maven
    ```
1. Sauce Credentials
    * In the terminal export your Sauce Labs Credentials as environmental variables:
    ```
    $ export SAUCE_USERNAME=<your Sauce Labs username>
    $ export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=<your Sauce Labs access key>
    ```

#### Steps to run it:

1. Clone the repo:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/diemol/frontend_testing.git
    ```
1. Change directory to execute this example

	```
    $ cd more-examples-parallel/java-testng/threads-and-browsers
	```
1. Execute the code

	```
	$ mvn test
	```

Afterwards you can check the executed test in your [Sauce Labs Dashboard](https://saucelabs.com/beta/dashboard/)


#### How does parallelism work in this example?
 
 The parallelism configuration for [TestNG](http://testng.org/doc/index.html) is configured via the [Surefire Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/), this can be seen [here](https://github.com/diemol/frontend_testing/blob/master/more-examples-parallel/java-testng/threads-and-browsers/pom.xml#L54).
 
 In this example, a dataprovider is configured with five different browser/platform configurations, which means that each test will be executed in each platform/browser configuration. The parameters used for `parallel` and `dataproviderthreadcount` are `methods` and `5` respectively. This means that five threads will be used to execute the tests generated by the combinations given by the dataprovider. A great explanation of this feature in TestNG can be seen [here](http://beust.com/weblog2/archives/000513.html).
 
 Something very important to be noted is how the `webDriver` variable is created, different from the single-threaded examples, the `webDriver` variable needs to be threadsafe because each session must be exclusive to avoid interference between tests. This example uses a `ThreadLocal<WebDriver>`, which is a common practice to keep the WebDriver session threadsafe.
