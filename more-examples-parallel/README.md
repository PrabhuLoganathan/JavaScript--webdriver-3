## WebDriver examples running in parallel

You can find here examples written in Java and JavaScript that show how tests can be executed in parallel, the folder structure is as follows:
* [Java-TestNG](https://github.com/diemol/frontend_testing/tree/master/more-examples-parallel/java-testng): Tests written in Java with [TestNG](http://testng.org/doc/index.html) as framework, and using the [Surefire plugin](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/) to configure the parallelism values and to pass them to TestNG.
  * [Threads](https://github.com/diemol/frontend_testing/tree/master/more-examples-parallel/java-testng/threads): Two WebDriver tests executed in two threads and a single browser. This is the situation where you have a large number of tests, and you want to run them in different threads to reduce the execution time, but in a single browser/platform combination.
  * [Threads and Browsers](https://github.com/diemol/frontend_testing/tree/master/more-examples-parallel/java-testng/threads-and-browsers): A TestNG dataprovider contains the configuration of the browser/platform combinations where the tests will be executed, and the tests are annotated with the dataprovider. This is the situation where you want to check your most important tests (e.g. e2e) in different browsers and platforms.
* [JS-Mocha-Chai](https://github.com/diemol/frontend_testing/tree/master/more-examples-parallel/js-mocha-chai): Tests written in JavaScript, using [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) to execute them and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) to perform assertions. [Mocha-Parallel-Tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha-parallel-tests) is used to split the tests in different threads.
  * [Threads](https://github.com/diemol/frontend_testing/tree/master/more-examples-parallel/js-mocha-chai/threads): Conceptually equivalent as the `Threads` example mentioned above for Java.
  * [Threads and Browsers](https://github.com/diemol/frontend_testing/tree/master/more-examples-parallel/js-mocha-chai/threads-and-browsers): A simple bi-dimensional array is used to configure the browser/platform combinations where the tests will be executed, and the tests are executed inside a `forEach` that loops over the bi-dimensional array. This is the situation where you want to check your most important tests (e.g. e2e) in different browsers and platforms.

All the examples are using [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/).
