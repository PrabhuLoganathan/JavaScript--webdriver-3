### WebDriver test example in Java and JavaScript

This is a simple test where a page is open, and then the title of the page is asserted vs. a expected value.

Implemented in [Java with TestNG](https://github.com/diemol/frontend_testing/tree/master/first-test/java-testng) and [JavaScript with Mocha and Chai](https://github.com/diemol/frontend_testing/tree/master/first-test/js-mocha-chai).
