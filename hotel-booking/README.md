### Hotel booking example using WebDriver in Java and JavaScript

This is an example where a guest user books a hotel.

Implemented in [Java with TestNG](https://github.com/diemol/frontend_testing/tree/master/hotel-booking/java-testng)
and [JavaScript with Mocha and Chai](https://github.com/diemol/frontend_testing/tree/master/hotel-booking/js-mocha-chai).

On each implementation, you will find two folders:
* Initial: Just contains a folder structure and some files to help you get started and develop the test.
* Complete: Contains a proposed solution for the exercise.
